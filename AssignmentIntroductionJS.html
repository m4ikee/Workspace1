                            <br><br>In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called

                            <span class = "par">When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: "LiveScript". But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a "younger brother" of Java would help. 
                                <br><br>But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called

                                Engines are complicated but the basics are easy:
                                <br><br>1. The engine (embedded if it's a browser) reads ("parses") the script.
                                <br><br>2. Then it converts ("compiles") the script to the machine language.
                                <br><br>3. And the machine code runs pretty fast
                                <br><br><br>The engine applies optimization at each step of the process. It even watches the compiled script as it runs, analyzes the data that flows through it, and further optimizes the machine code based on that knowledge
