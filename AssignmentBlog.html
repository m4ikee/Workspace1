                Before they became known as the "Worst Generation", the eleven Supernovas were the top rookie pirates from nine different crews who all chose one of the seven routes along the 
                <a href = "https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Line">Grand Line</a>
                They comprised of the captains of said crews, as well as two other crewmates, whose bounties are all above the threshold of  100,000,000. Each of them comes from one of all five seasâ€” the

                 the Grand Line itself and even the

                A common trait they all possess is that they have caught the attention of the World Government and have survived many ordeals that have wiped out most other pirate crews during their voyage in the Grand Line. Though they are all on par with each other as far as threat level is concerned, they represent different views on piracy.<br><br>

                Coincidentally, all the Supernovas arrived on the Sabaody Archipelago at the same time which caused a series of issues for the

                almost simultaneously. Marshall D. Teach, on the other hand, was already in the New World by the time the rookies were making preparations.<br><br>
                The Supernovas are notable for posing the greatest threat to the balance of the

                one of the Supernovas could potentially be responsible for inspiring a whole new generation of pirates, a comment that is made true when it was revealed that Luffy inspired

                to become an infamous pirate in his own right. According to

                he firmly believes that one of the members of the Worst Generation will become the next

                <a href = "https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Killer">Killer</a>)
                are captains of their respective pirate crews and only one (Zoro) is not a

                did not grant any powers, only robbed him of his abilities to swim and express negative feelings). The relationship between the pirate captains usually depends on the situation they happen to find each other in. This can range from casual talk to starting a fight. It seems all members carry a certain level of respect for each other due to their shared status, even if they happen to be fighting for different sides. In fact, most of them have formed
                <a href = "https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Pirate_Alliance">pirate alliances</a>
                to achieve a common goal, although there have been several cases of confrontations among members as well.
